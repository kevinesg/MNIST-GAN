# MNIST data generator using GAN
Run `generate_data.py` to generate new data. You can adjust the `CLASS_SIZE` (number of generated data points per class). I used Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) here since the dataset is composed of images. You can see samples of synthetic images produced by the GAN after each class. Finally, the new dataset is attached to the original MNIST dataset, but you can always edit it so that the new dataset will be a separate file from the original MNIST dataset. You can see below some sample synthetic images produced by the GAN.
